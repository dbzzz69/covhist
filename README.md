**Covid-19: An alternate history**

  

### 

**Aim**

### 

  

This archive is intended to be collaborative effort to capture the change in narrative on the SARS-CoV2 situation in Western media. It may show how, we went from a sense of proportionality around the disease, to hysteria, and the resulting disastrous policy decisions.

**How?**

We'll upload a variety of information from various sources. MSM, alternative media, academic to a central drop-box, ideally with some accompanying notes as to why the uploader believed the source was worth including. For this, we can fill out an accompanying relevance statement (blank here):

[Blank relevance statement](https://github.com/dbzzz69/covhist/blob/main/relevance%20statement%20blank.docx)

  

Naturally why an article is considered relevant will vary from person to person. This is a good thing.

  

Upload each article into its own folder (PDF preferred), with a meaningful folder name, with the relevance statement in the same folder. An example is attached: [here](https://github.com/dbzzz69/covhist/tree/main/NHS%20pressure%202018)

**What happens next?**

Not a whole lot. Perhaps I/we can make a periodically updating infographic showcasing the reaction/change in narrative across these years, as a way of jogging people's short memories.

 It might also serve as a response to showcase the relative calm we had prior to march 2020. It may also serve as a central source for people to link to on social media when making whatever arguments they want to make.
